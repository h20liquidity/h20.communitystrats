# Strategy: Oracle based DCA, uniswap v3
#
# High level, this strategy trades mean amount of USDC denominated LINK tokens at the end of every cooldown period
# provided that current calculated USDC denominated price of LINK falls within the price gird.
#
# - Amount of LINK bought/sold per trade within the price band is randomized and centered around a mean,
#   value for which can be set within the bindings.
# - Range for the grid can also be provided within the bindings.
# - Strategy provides a guard against orcale manipulation by enforcing that the ratio of the current price offered
#   by the order to the 30 min average price is within the threshold, which can be provided as a binding in the strategy.
